# Multiparametric Optimization README

## üìò Introduction

Multiparametric optimization is a crucial technique in chemical engineering, focusing on optimizing functions with multiple variables to enhance processes and systems. This method is essential in areas such as process design, reaction engineering, and process control, where optimizing complex systems with numerous interacting parameters is necessary for efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The goal is to identify the optimal set of parameters that maximize or minimize the target function, such as yield, purity, or energy consumption. This involves employing gradient-based methods, Hessian matrices, and other advanced techniques to navigate the multidimensional search space. Mastering multiparametric optimization is vital for developing sophisticated algorithms and solutions to address intricate challenges in chemical engineering, thereby improving process performance and innovation.

## üöÄ Project Overview

In this project, I have implemented multiparametric optimization on a system with three inputs and four outputs. This repository includes the following key components:

1. **Response Surface Methodology (RSM) Curve Fitting**: Used to find the relationships of individual output variables with the input variables.
2. **Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm**: Applied to determine the most optimal input variable values to achieve the desired range of output variables.
